# Exo Planet Populations for the Habitable Worlds Observatory

This project is meant to make a quick and dirty simulation of exoplanets from the solar neighbouhood and set observational requirements for the HWO.

Some of the Assumptions
1. All Planets are in circular orbits
2. All Planets and stars and perfect spheres
3. All Planets in a particular system are in the same plane
